Math was my favorite subject in high school, so I stick with it and start my college with a math major, although I'm good at it, I don't feel like doing it forever, it is way too traditional, I want to be innovative and I love new technology, the computer science class in college really got me interested in coding, as the time goes on, my interest in coding grows larger and larger, until now I can say coding is a career I want, and I want to build my own software eventually.
